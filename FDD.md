# Functional Design Document (FDD)
## General description
This will be a 2D top-down roleplaying game fork of "Beestation", a Space Station 13 fork in which I will be creating more items, teams, rounds and items.

## Functional requirements
- Have added atleast 1 new "antagonist" role to play as.
- Have added atleast 1 new "Station Crew" role to play as.
- Have added an completely new item from scratch with a new sprite, if needed.
- Have understood the basic code and how to change/edit/add code myself as the language itself is very complex.
- Have learnt how to make my own map and "adventure-zones".
- Adding in an improvement and some sort of database to handle certain interactions like bans and warnings.
- Having made a new chemical or element to use in chemistry/botany.
## Non-Functional Requirements
- Having included a new gamemode to play, something "Survival" or "Murder Mystery" related.
- Have basic understanding on how to alter content within the station, or to have different maps with all kinds of special actions
- Having reworked part of the admin panel to my own liking.
